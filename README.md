Understanding and Predicting Customer Churn: A Data-Driven Approach
Introduction
Customer churn, the rate at which customers stop using a product or service, poses a significant challenge for businesses. In this era of machine learning, companies leverage classification models to predict and analyze customer churn, aiming to understand the underlying factors influencing customer attrition. This article presents a chronological exploration of a customer churn prediction project, outlining key steps, findings, and actionable recommendations for businesses and their teams.

Project Description
Our project focused on a telecommunications company aiming to comprehend customer data and determine the factors affecting customer churn. The objective was to build a robust machine learning pipeline capable of predicting churn accurately. Following the CRISP-DM methodology, we conducted a comprehensive analysis, and our findings are presented herein.

Data for the Project
The dataset, comprising 5,000 records, was divided into training, evaluation, and testing sets. The data included diverse attributes such as gender, tenure, internet service type, payment method, and, crucially, the churn status. Rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing ensured data reliability.

Data Understanding
We delved into the data exploration phase, using various packages to understand attributes, organization, and data quality. The dataset covered diverse customer information, from gender to contract type, providing a comprehensive view of customer behavior.

Hypothesis and Research Questions
To guide our analysis, we formulated a hypothesis regarding the relationship between total charges and customer churn. Additionally, research questions were posed to explore aspects such as the distribution of churn for different internet service types, the impact of having a partner or dependents, the influence of contract types, the relationship between payment methods and churn, and gender-based churn rates.

Hypothesis Testing
The Kruskal-Wallis test yielded a significant relationship between total charges and customer churn. This finding prompted actionable insights for businesses to tailor retention strategies based on customer spending patterns.

Research Questions and Recommendations
Q1: Internet Service Types
Findings:
DSL customers exhibit higher loyalty.
Fiber optic customers have a significant churn rate.
Customers without internet service are less likely to churn.
Recommendations:
Segment-specific strategies: Tailor retention efforts based on each internet service type.
Customer experience improvement: Address common issues in the fiber optic category to enhance satisfaction.
Promotions and upselling: Targeted efforts for customers without internet service to increase revenue.
Q2: Having a Partner or Dependents
Recommendations:
Targeted marketing campaigns: Develop strategies to attract and retain customers without dependents.
Enhanced senior citizen programs: Offer exclusive promotions for senior citizens.
Promote partner-centric services: Design marketing strategies emphasizing benefits for customers with partners.
Q3: Contract Types
Recommendations:
Promote long-term contracts: Develop campaigns highlighting the benefits of extended contracts.
Incentivize long-term subscriptions: Offer special incentives for customers committing to longer contracts.
Transparent communication: Clearly communicate advantages and terms of long-term contracts.
Q4: Payment Method
Recommendations:
Promote credit card usage: Incentivize customers to use credit cards for payments.
Improve electronic check process: Investigate and enhance user-friendliness.
Consider incentives for bank transfer: Offer discounts for customers using bank transfer.
Q5: Gender
Recommendations:
Targeted strategies: Tailor marketing and service strategies based on identified gender preferences.
Overall churn management: Use insights to improve customer satisfaction and implement gender-specific retention initiatives.
Conclusion on Hypothesis Testing
The Kruskal-Wallis test established a significant relationship between total charges and customer churn. This implies businesses can tailor retention strategies based on customer spending patterns, enhancing overall customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Considerations and Recommendations to the Team
Causation vs. correlation: Further analysis is needed to establish causation between identified factors and churn.
Customer feedback: Combine quantitative analysis with qualitative data to gain a comprehensive understanding of churn reasons.
Ethical considerations: Handle gender-related data ethically, respecting privacy and avoiding discriminatory practices.
Data Preparation for Machine Learning
The team meticulously cleaned and prepared the dataset, splitting it into input and target sets for machine learning. A pipeline was created to train selected models, including Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boosting. Over-sampling methods addressed data imbalance.

Model Evaluation and Selection
The team evaluated model performance and selected the top three models: Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Feature selection using mutual information enhanced model interpretability.

ROC Curve Analysis
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for model comparison. The Gradient Boost classifier emerged as the best-performing model, indicating a balance between sensitivity and specificity.

Business Implications
Understanding ROC curves aids in selecting models that balance false positives and false negatives, aligning with specific business requirements. The findings offer actionable insights for businesses to optimize customer retention strategies
